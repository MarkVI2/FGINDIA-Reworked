# FGINDIA-Reworked
This project is under construction and is a continuation on the original FGIndia. 
This project includes the airports and the models covering most of the Indian regions. 
Ground Layouts will be taken from the previous project. 
We do not mean to copy/plagiarise others projects.
We will be adding models, parking gates, updated NavData and various other things that we feel the scenery is lacking in. 
We will make new layouts if the exsisting layouts seem to be out of date.
**Credits will be provided** to the right personal. (please check info(apt).txt for the credits file for each airport)
Please contact us on discord (https://discord.gg/UbvYQZUKzx) or our email (fgindia.contact@gmail.com)for any copyright infringment or any possible scenery report you wish to make.
