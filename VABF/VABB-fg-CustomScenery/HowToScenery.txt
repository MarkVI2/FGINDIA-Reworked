Navigate to "Additional Scenery Folders" and click "Add". Navigate through the folders to your downloaded scenery folder, select it, and click add/ok. Voila your latest scenery should be added to your FG. You can fly around in the scenery by navigating to the "Locations" tab, typing in your airport ICAO/Name/IATA code and selecting a start position.
