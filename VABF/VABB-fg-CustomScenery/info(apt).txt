This scenery package contains the updated terrain layouts and the osm scenery buildings and roads (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport). The scenery is in constant development. So ensure to check out for updates regarding light fixtures and slum building. We will be adding models, parking gates, updated NavData and various other things that we feel the scenery is lacking in. We will make new layouts if the existing layouts seem to be out of date. Credits will be provided to the right personal. Please contact us on discord ( https://discord.gg/5b4uTJKFB3 ) or our email ( fgindia.contact@gmail.com ) for any copyright infringement or any possible scenery report you wish to make.
